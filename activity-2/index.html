<head> Things to do at EACH Park </head>
<title> Going to each park on your first visit is overwhelming but amazing!</title>
<body> As an avid goer to DisneyWorld, I try to make it to at least two parks
when I am there, if not my three favorite! I make sure I have a loosely made
schedule so I know the places I have to visit before my day at the park
ends. I have some information below to consider, but do not hesitate to email
me using the link below!

<table id="simple table">
  <tr>
    <th>Park</th>
    <th>Hours</th>
    <th>Highlight</th>
    <th></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Magic Kingdom</th>
    <th>9a-10p</th>
    <th>Cinderella's Castle</th>
    <th><img src="Cinderella_Castle.jpg"

    <th>Hollywood Studios</th>
    <th>9a-8p</th>
    <th>Toy Story Land</th>
    <th><img src="Toy_Storyland.jpg"
    alt="New! Toy Story Land"
    style="width:100px;height:100px;"></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Epcot</th>
    <th>9a-9p</th>
    <th>The Ball</th>
    <th><img src="Epcot_Ball.jpg"
    alt="The Epcot Ball"
    style="width:100px;height:100px;"></th>
  </tr>
  <body> With that, I give you the eye-catchers of each park! Not at all saying
    that these are the best aspects of the parks, as that is each a personal
    opinion but these are the things you will see nearly immediately. This
    next table shows all the pros and cons of each park, as I feel.</body>
