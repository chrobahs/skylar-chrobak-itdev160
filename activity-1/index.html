      <hl> Best Things to remember on your DisneyWorld Trip </hl>
      <p>This list is what an avid traveler needs for both essential things to pack
       and the top places to stop while in the parks.</p>
       <h2> The essentials for your Disney Trip </h2>
       <p>When going to Disney, it is very important to remember some of the main needs
       that you would take going to a normal outing, so that you don't buy Disney's
       overpriced version.</p>
       <b>Ponchos,</b><p> with Florida's weather fluctuations, Dollar Tree ponchos are a cheap
        and easy way to stay dry in case of flash rain!</p>
       <b>A comfortable backpack,</b> <p>I know that there are many amazing collaborations of
       purses with Disney, my favorite being Vera Bradley. I like to carry their mini
       backpack, which carries the needs for just one person. They also have the school
       sized backpack that is allowed in Disney and will hold a whole family's needs.</p>
