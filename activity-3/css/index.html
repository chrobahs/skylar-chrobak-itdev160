      <p>Backpacks are amazing for when you are with your family,
      or you are not staying on resort where you can just have your things sent
    back to your room. Water, pin lanyards, Mouse-ear headbands and leftovers
    fit while still being comfortable to carry. Also buy one with the pockets
    for water bottles/cups in case you don't want to carry them.</p>
    <h3> Bag Types: Large Crossbody</h3>

      <p>Large crossbodies are good for a wallet and a nice camera to have the
      photographers use, and a place to put your ears if you don't want to wear
    them all day, which I get because mine end up giving headaches still.</p>
    <h4> Bag Types: Small/Mini Crossbody</h4>
