    <h2>#1 Bag Types: Backpacks</h2>

      <p>Backpacks are amazing for when you are with your family,
      or you are not staying on resort where you can just have your things sent
    back to your room. Water, pin lanyards, Mouse-ear headbands and leftovers
    fit while still being comfortable to carry. Also buy one with the pockets
    for water bottles/cups in case you don't want to carry them.</p>
    <h3>#2 Bag Types: Large Crossbody</h3>

      Vera Bradley Large Hipster</a>
    <p>Large crossbodies are good for a wallet and a nice camera to have the
    photographers use, and a place to put your ears if you don't want to wear
    them all day, which I get because mine end up giving headaches still.</p>
    <h4>#3 Bag Types: Small/Mini Crossbody</h4>

      <p>This bag is the best bag if someone only needs to carry a small wallet
      and your phone. It is compact but helpful as there is no extra storing
      on rides, like tucking it underneath the seat ahead of you.</p>

    <footer> Which ever bag you choose, the most important part is that you are
    comfortable, as it will be what you wear all day, and in your pictures!
    And of course there are other products besides these to choose from but
    cloth purses tend to be the best because they do not get super sundamagedt get super sun damaged
    and they do not get stiff like leather might.</footer>
